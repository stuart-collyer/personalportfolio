## Project Description

This project was completed as part of the Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer Course. The task was to build a personal portfolio web page to showcase some of the projects completed during the course so far.

### Objectives

* Build a website using HTML and CSS
* Add at least one interactive feature using JavaScript
* Use Git version control
* Use the command line and file navigation
* Develop locally on your computer
* Deploy site to the web using GitHub Pages
* Use GitHub
* Include contact details

### Prerequisites

* JavaScript
* Git and GitHub (including a readme file)
* Command line in Terminal.
* GitHub Pages
* HTML/CSS
* Command line and file navigation

## Solution

I selected 4 projects to include on the portfolio site:

1. Challenge Project - Website Design Guide
2. Challenge Project - Cheat Sheet
3. Challenge Project - Fake Business Home Page (Fanfare Trumpets)
4. Portfolio Project - Mixed Messages (Fake sport Headline Generator)

There is a screenshot of each project. Clicking the screenshot navigates to the web page (hosted on GitHub Pages). The Mixed Messages project is a javascript node.js program so clicking the screenshot navigates to the GitHub repo for this project.

To satisfy the requirement to have a javascript interactivity feature, I included a selection box (top left corner) for changing the color theme of the portfolio page. Options included are:

1. Default - The color scheme page uses when loaded
2. Barbie - Mostly pink!
3. USA - Red, White and Blue
4. Brat - Have A Brat Summer in Lime Green! (Credit: Charlie XCX)
5. Monochrome - Accessible black and white color scheme

A set of technology icons is included (using FontAwesome) after each project description to indicate the technologies used on the project.
   
Javascript was also used to display the current date and format it with the correct ordinal for the day of the month.

### Design Features

To organise and layout the page I utilised CSS Grid as I had not used it before.

To achieve the color scheme change I used javascript to swap out and in, classes on styled elements.

#### Lessons Learned

Learnt how useful CSS grid is for laying out a web site. This will help me to be more ambitious in this area going forward.

This was the first time manipulating the DOM so great to consolidate what I had learnt on the course.

By placing all the projects to be included on the site, under git version control, publishing them to GitHub repos and GitHub pages, helped me to get comfortable using these tools.
